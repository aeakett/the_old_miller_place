<i>&ldquo;Johnson&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yeah sarg?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;We just got a call from Mrs. Henderson. Says she hasn&rsquo;t seen little Sandy since before lunch today.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be good.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No, I dare say it can&rsquo;t. She says the last time she saw her she was headed in the direction of the old Miller place.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get right on it sarg.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;You better hurry Johnson&hellip; it&rsquo;ll be getting dark soon.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Some folks say that the old Miller place is haunted. The widow Miller died a few years back and the place has been empty since then. Sort of sad really… she lived there all alone ever since I can remember. They say that she was once a beauty with a baby and a brave husband that went off to war. Wasn&rsquo;t long though until the government man came to her door with the news that her husband&rsquo;d been killed. That&rsquo;s when things started to go down hill for the widow Miller. She shut herself off from the world, and wasn&rsquo;t seen much more than a couple times a month when she went to the store for supplies. As the years wore on there wasn&rsquo;t any sign of the baby Miller, but her mother claimed that she was schooling her at home… where she&rsquo;d be safe from the world. That satisfied most folks just fine, as did the news one spring that the Miller child hadn&rsquo;t survived the particularly hash winter. The widow Miller rebuffed all attempts to help her lay her child to rest, claiming that she&rsquo;d take care of it herself, putting the child next to her father&rsquo;s marker in the back of the property. Such a sad story… it&rsquo;s no wonder that the widow Miller became even more of a recluse.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;It was good and dark by the time I made it out to the Miller place, and sure enough there were fresh tracks near the house of a child about Sally&rsquo;s size. Peering through the windows didn&rsquo;t reveal anything, so I opened the back door and headed into what should have been the kitchen.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s right in this place&hellip; none of the rooms seem to be where they should. I can hear little Sally, but the sound of her voice seems to come from everywhere at once. There&rsquo;s other sounds too, but they&rsquo;re not of this earth. Better find Sally and get out of here before I find the source of those sounds (or it finds me).&rdquo;</i><br />
<br />
Place the six house tiles down randomly. Make sure that each tile is connected to a neighbouring one by matching connector marks on each tile. Also make sure that there are at least two connectors around the perimiter of the house. These will be the doors that our hero can enter and exit through. If there are more than two doors around the perimeter pick two to use and ignore the others. Pick which door our hero will enter through and place the blue pawn outside of the house by that door.<br />
<br />
<i>&ldquo;In a place as old and run down as this there are a ton of places that little Sandy could be hiding.&rdquo;</i><br />
<br />
For each room, roll a die to randomly determine which square to place one of the tokens face down on (if the die comes up 5 or 6, reroll&hellip; and don&rsquo;t peek at the tokens!).<br />
<br />
<i>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real mess in here, and I&rsquo;ll need to be careful that I don&rsquo;t trip on something in all of this trash&hellip; this is going to be slow going.&rdquo;</i><br />
<br />
Each round, roll a die to determine how many spaces our hero will move. On a roll of 1-3 he&rsquo;ll only manage one space, on a roll of 4-6 he can move 2. Inside of a room, diagonal movement is allowed, but doors must be passed straight through.<br />
<br />
<i>&ldquo;Oh I definitely heard something&hellip; what the hell was that?&rdquo;</i><br />
<br />
After the hero&rsquo;s turn is complete, the ghost of the widow Miller makes her move. If the ghost (the white pawn) is not already in the house, roll a die to determine which room she appears in, and roll again to determine the square. The ghost moves 1-3 spaces per turn (roll a die: 1-2=1 sp, 3-4=2 sp, 5-6=3 sp). The widow Miller&rsquo;s main concern is getting our hero out of her home, so most of the time she will move in his general direction, but she sometimes gets distracted in a house full of memories. On the box bottom (inside and out) you&rsquo;ll find two movement tables. Roll on the inside one when the direction between the ghost and her target is more of a straight line. Roll on the outside table when her target is more on a diagonal. Roll once for each space moved. If at any time the ghost&rsquo;s move takes her ouside of the house, her movement is done, and she will re-appear randomly next turn. The ghost of the widow Miller may move through walls.<br />
<br />
<i>&ldquo;This looks as likely a hiding spot as any, I&rsquo;d better see of Sandy&rsquo;s in here somewhere.&rdquo;</i><br />
<br />
When our hero enters a square with a face-down token, flip it over.<br />
<br />
<i>&ldquo;Huh, an old memento.&rdquo;</i><br />
<br />
Red bordered tokens represent mementos that evoke a strong emotional response in the ghost of the widow Miller. Roll a die. A roll of 1-4 means that our hero gets a feeling of dread and decides that the object shouldn&rsquo;t be disturbed (<i>&ldquo;This must be the baby Miller&rsquo;s old receiving blanket&hellip; no need to disturb that&rdquo;</i>). In this case leave the token face up on the board. If, during her movement, the ghost lands on one of these face-up tokens, she is stricken with grief and ends her movement and is removed from the house. On a roll of 5 or 6, our hero&rsquo;s resolve is bolstered and decides to take it with him (<i>&ldquo;Well look at this old photo of the Millers&hellip; they were a lovely family once&rdquo;</i>). Remove the token from the board and set it aside&hellip; it may save our hero&rsquo;s life later.<br />
<br />
The black bordered token represents the mortal remains of the baby Miller (<i>&ldquo;Oh good lord!&rdquo;</i>). This token is left in place. Before the ghost&rsquo;s movement begins, roll a die. On a roll of 1-4 she remains focused on removing the intruder from her home, but on a 5 or 6 this token becomes her target and she moves towards it instead of our hero this turn. If she enters the square with this token, she ends her movement for the turn. On her next turn, she will only remain on the square and not move if the roll to determine her target is 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
The yellow bordered token represents little Sandy (<i>&ldquo;Sandy, oh thank god! Are you alright? Come on, let&rsquo;s get you out of here.&rdquo;</i>). Remove the token form the board. Our hero&rsquo;s job is nearly done, and he just needs to make it out of the house.<br />
<br />
If there is only one unturned token in the house, turn it over. If it is little Sandy, leave it in place. If it isn&rsquo;t, replace it with the Sandy token (<i>"Why is it that things are always in the last place I look?&rdquo;</i>).<br />
<br />
<i>&ldquo;What is that? A light? A mote of dust? Wha&hellip; *augh!*&rdquo;</i><br />
<br />
If at any time our hero and the ghost of the widow Miller end up in the same square, a contest of wills ensues. Roll a die for the ghost and one for our hero. The highest roll wins the contest (with ties being in favour of the widow Miller). If our hero prevails, the ghost disapparates from the house and will return randomly next turn. If our hero loses, the terror of the encounter is too much for him to bear and the game is over.<br />
<br />
However, if our hero possesses a memento token, it provides a momentary surge of resolve. Discard the token and begin a new contest of wills (<i>&ldquo;That photo of the Millers reminds me of my own family, and Sandy&rsquo;s too&hellip; and we&rsquo;re both going home to our loved ones tonight if it&rsquo;s the last thing I do!&rdquo;</i>).<br />
